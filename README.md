# Mobile_price_range_prediction

In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices.

The aim of this project is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price.

In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is, 0(low cost), 1 (medium cost), 2(high cost), 3(very high cost).

I have used python libraries such as pandas,seaborn,numpy and sklearn to develop the prediction algorithm.

Have also performed a detailed Exploratory data analysis and visualisation.
